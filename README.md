# Early Detection of Acute Kidney Injury using Machine Learning

This repository contains a comprehensive project on the early prediction of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) leveraging machine learning models. AKI is a critical condition necessitating prompt diagnosis to prevent long-term complications. Led by Prof. Dr. Md. Asraf Ali, our team - Esm-e Moula Cowdhury Abha, Md. Wahiduzzaman Suva, and Md. Imtiaj Alam Sajin - embarked on this endeavor to enhance healthcare decision-making and patient care.

## Introduction

Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a sudden reduction in kidney function characterized by symptoms such as decreased urine production, edema, and disorientation. It is critical to make an accurate diagnosis as soon as possible using urine output changes, blood testing, and imaging. Treatment varies depending on the reason and may include treatments such as stopping hazardous medicines or, in severe circumstances, dialysis. Prevention focuses on controlling health issues and preventing things that affect the kidneys. Early identification is critical for improved results and the prevention of long-term harm.

We implemented several classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Network, and employed feature extraction techniques such as variance thresholding and ANOVA F-statistic to extract informative features from the images.

## Methodology

Our methodology encompasses various stages including data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, normalization, model selection, training, assessment, and continuous monitoring. We employed meticulous techniques to ensure data integrity and model reliability. Classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Network were explored to predict AKI.


## Dependencies

- numpy 
- pandas 
- scikit-learn 
- tensorflow 
- keras
  
## Data Collection and Preprocessing

- We collected MRI and CT scan images from public datasets and applied rigorous preprocessing steps to ensure data quality and consistency.
- Preprocessing steps included normalization, resizing, and feature extraction. The preprocessed data is available in the 'data' directory.

## Model Training and Evaluation

- We trained the machine learning models using the preprocessed data, fine-tuning hyperparameters and performing cross-validation to optimize performance. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to assess model performance.


## Results and Discussion

Our analysis provides insights into the efficacy of different algorithms in AKI prediction. We emphasize the significance of early detection in improving patient outcomes and propose avenues for future research.

## Conclusion and Future Recommendations

The early detection of AKI holds immense promise for enhancing healthcare decision-making and patient care. We invite collaboration and feedback from the healthcare and data science communities to further refine our approach and contribute to advancing medical diagnostics.
